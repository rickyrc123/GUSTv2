This is the test socket, it sends random data to simulate recieving data from a drone

To run it, open two terminals.
    Then start test_socket_server.py, this is what will recieve the messages,
    Once test_socket_server.py is running... run the test_socket_client.py to send random data to the server.

How is this useful?
    By opening the websocket on whatever you may be testing, you can recieve random input data from the client. The current test_server only serves as a base for now. Use it as an example of how to recieve messages send to the socket.

Helpdesk:

    If you need something added, add it yourself (its not that hard), or send a request to (708) 240-0992 for direct tech support. This is my number (Nick), or just say something in the discord. Not really sure how this will be used at the moment, but did my best to lay the foundation.
