# Ground Control Station for Uncrewed Teams and Swarms

Welcome to the homepage for GUSTv2! This project is an open source ground control system for planning missions and controlling teams and swarms of uncrewed vehicles. GUSTv2 runs on a Python FastAPI backend and uses pymavlink to connect to and command vehicles. Its front end is built in React and Electron. The program has been designed to allow for easy integration with other custom modules. 

 
  
## Core Features
 - Multiple simultaneous connections managed in real time (in progress)
 - One-Click mission execution for multi-vehicle plans (in progress)
 - Planning widget for teams (in progress)
 - Ability to design, save, edit, and upload vehicle paths multiple vehicles (in progress)
 - Real time tele-op control in case of emergencies (in progress)
 - Real time telemetry/sensor streaming and logging (in progress)
 
 ## Planned features
  - TAK integration
  - Path validator for custom vehicle types 
 

GUSTv2 aims to function as an all in one ground station for planning and controlling teams and swarms of vehicle. We want to provide a performance focused piece of software that is simple to install and use on Windows and Linux platforms. GUSTv2 is simple to modify and built on widely supported technologies. Our goal is to provide the casual user and developer alike with a robust and simple software package to control any vehicle that supports the MavLink communication protocol.
