        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>GUSTv2 is an open-source ground control system for planning missions and controlling teams and swarms of uncrewed vehicles as well as building and holding multiple flight paths. It is designed to be simple to use and highly customizable.</p>

        <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time telemetry and sensor streaming</li>
            <li>Mission planning and execution</li>
            <li>Multi-vehicle support</li>
            <li>Emergency protocols</li>
            <li>Customizable path design</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use GUST</h2>
        <h3 id="screens">Screens</h3>
        <p>GUST is organized into three screens. The first screen is the telemetry and flight screen. After a maneuver has been planned, it will appear in the left column. Selecting a maneuver will populate the map with all vehicles included in the maneuver. A list of these vehicles will appear in the list to the right of the map.</p>
        <p>The second screen is the planning screen. On the left is the maneuver selector and vehicle selctor. Here you can create, delete, and select maneuvers. To plan a path for a vehicle, select a maneuver, select the vehicle you want to plan for, and click "start new path". Click on the new tab that appeared in the point editor on the right side of the screen to see the points as you select them. Next, click on the map to drop waypoints for you path. When you are finished, click "Add to maneuver". You should see the maneuver you selected now has a drone and path tied to it on the left side of the screen. You can only have one path per vehicle per maneuver. By selecting a path in the point editor on the right side of the screen, you can delete points from the path. When you select a path, you can press the export button to download a csv of the selected path.</p>
        <p>The third screen is the connection screen. This screen is not fully implemented yet and is still considered a WIP</p>
        <h2 id="setup">Front End Set Up</h2>
        <p>The front end will be eventually compiled in a binary that can be installed and ran. However, for now, to run the front end simply navigate to the gust-react directory and run the command "npm run dev"</p>

        <h2 id="setup">Fast API Backend</h2>
        <p>The app runs on a fastAPI backend written in python 3 and run in a Ubuntu 22.04 docker container for development purposes. The app itself runs as an electron app.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To view api endpoints visit localhost:8000/docs while the app is running</li>
            <li>Install the required dependencies using the provided <code>environment.yml</code> file.</li>
            <li>Run the Docker container using <code>docker compose up --build</code>.</li>
        </ol>
